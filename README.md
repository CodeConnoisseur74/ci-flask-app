## Testing

PEP8, flake and Black Formatter was used to test and find errors. Only syntax errors were found. Renaming of functions and variables according to PEP8 documentation was carried out and refactored using PyCharm before confirming and copying over to VSCode in Gitpod.

## Deployment

### Heroku

This program was deployed to Heroku, following the below steps:

```
Push most up-to-date code to Github

Create a list of requirements by typing the following into the terminal: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

Push the requirements to Github

Logon to Heroku

Select create new app

Add app name

Add app region

Select 'Create app'

Open up the Settings tab, on the top ribbon

In 'Config Vars' select 'Reveal Config Vars'

Add 'PORT' as a key and '8000' as a value

In 'Buildpacks' select 'Add buildpack' and choose python. Then, repeat for nodejs (order is important; python first followed by nodejs)

Navigate to 'Deploy' on the top ribbon

In 'Deployment method', select 'Github', once clicked it should say 'connected'

Enter a repository in Github to connect to and click 'Search'

Once repository has been found, click 'Connect' to link new app to Github repository

In 'Automatic deploys', select the 'Enable Automatic Deploy' option

To view your command line on the Heroku platform, once a new code has been pushed to Github, log on to Heroku

Select the required app that appears on your home screen

Select 'Open app' on the right hand side of the screen

The app should appear in a new tab on the web browser

The link to my Heroku app is: https://cli-battleship-game.herokuapp.com/ 
```
